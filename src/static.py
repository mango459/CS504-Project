'''This module defines static variables that may change from user to user. Define these here and do
not push your changes. This file should be inlcuded in the .gitignore for the repos.

For example:
    DATA_DIR serves at the path on your machine in which the data for the project will be located.
    Formatting this once here and then using this variable throughout the code will enalbe multiple
    developers with completely different local file trees to run the same bit of code without having
    to continually modify the actual code, you just modify it here and then import this variable to
    the subsequent scripts.

DONT PUSH THIS FILE ONCE YOU'VE FILLED IT OUT, ITS ON THE GITIGNORE BUT BE VIGILANT'''

DATA_DIR: str = "/home/mango/data/CS504"
